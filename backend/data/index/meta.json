A \ncritical part of what we do is growing the next generation of leaders, especially through mentorship.   From the time you \nenter our Air Force, until the time you separate or retire, I urge you to be active with mentorship, whether you are \nproviding or receiving.   This mentorship g uide was written to support your efforts.  \nMuch like the “face to face” mentorship you receive, this guide is not perfect or all encompassing.   There are even some \nsections we will need to author.   And that is ok.   There are lessons and stories you will ch erish while others may be less \npertinent at this point in your career.   The important part, is that this document will help serve as a foundational \nreference you can turn to in order to start answer ing questions that arise.   If you think there is a section  to add, or you \nwant to make a contribution or update, please contact our Corps office at usaf.pentagon.af -sg.mbx.msc -corps -\noffice@mail.mil.    \nThank you to every Medical Service Corps Officer that dedicated their time and talent to make this a reality.  \nSincerely,  \nSUSAN J.

This is \ntrue both among MSCs – because there are only about a thousand of us in the Air Force – \nand as an officer.  Your reputation will grow with you throughout your career, being \nmolded and shaped by your actions, decisions, and character.  The perception of who you \nare as an Airman and as a MSC will be communicated through your career documents \n(OPRs, decorations, awards, etc.), by word-of-mouth, and by what you post online.  Your \nreputation matters because it will, inevitably, be a factor as your career is vectored and you \nare being considered for your future assignments.  It will also play a part in determining \nhow you fit into the overall plan for the AFMS.  For example, if you have a reputation of \nbeing a strong leader with an ability to find the “yes,” a Senior MSC on the DT wi ll know \nthose things about you.  They will use that knowledge to vector you to a position that \nrequires those attributes for success at the assignment level.  Furthermore, a good \nreputation can inspire others to have trust and respect for you even before you sign in to a \nnew assignment.  Conversely, a bad reputation can have the opposite effect.  It will require \nyou to work even harder to change the perception your subordinate",

It will require \nyou to work even harder to change the perception your subordinates, peers, and leaders \nhave of you to get your job done.  \n1.1.1. PERCEPTION VS. REALITY \nYour reputation is shaped, in part, by perception.  Those perceptions begin in reality with \nan action (on or off duty) and may change as opinions are formed.  By and large, \nperceptions are a product of those opinions people establish as they evaluate what you did \nand how you did it.  What’s more, those perceptions evolve and are altered as the opinions \nare passed from person to person arriving at a moment when someone is asking about you \n– the moment when your reputation becomes reality in the inquirer’s mi nd.  We regularly\nhear that “perception is reality” , and this example is the point in time when it becomes true.\nYou can influence people’s perception of you by being as open, honest, and transparent as\n\n \n9  you can be about the decisions you make.  This is par ticularly true for controversial \ndecisions and choices that resulted in a negative outcome or that were wrong.  Everyone \nhas made decisions that they wish they could go back and change, and outside opinions \nabout those decisions will undoubtedly be formed.

Their perception doesn’t have to be correct for it to become their \nreality.  \n \nI was a single female Lt RMO going to a working lunch  with a married male Major \nLogistics officer.  We spent lunch drafting our closeout plan.  When I returned I got \nfeedback that the lunch wasn’t a good idea.

W hile \nfraternization is still a crime under the UCMJ, Air Force life has changed over the years. \nNow you have Airmen  earning commissions who are married to Airmen  and families with \nboth enlisted and officer members.

Completing the project at the bowling alley and then bowling a few games and \nhaving a celebratory brew… not so good.   \nThe senior ranking individual sets the tone of the relationship.  Maintain customs and \ncourtesies,  and no one will wonder. \nIf it doesn’t feel right, it probably isn’t.  \nWhen I played on the base basketball team, I got yelled at by our coach, who was a TSgt.  \nThat was ok ay.  Outside the gym, I was just “Lt” . \nUsing customs and courtesies (Ma’am, Sir, Capt, etc.) makes it easier to not go over the \nline. \nThe intent of our fraternization rules is to prevent the appearance of partiality, and to \nprotect good order, discipline, authority and morale.

FAVORITISM \nLt Col Liana Vogel, Commander, 49th Medical Support Squadron, Holloman AFB \nAccording to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, favoritism is the showing of special favor \nor partiality.  Throughout your career, you will have to keep it in-check as a supervisor, a \nsubordinate and as a peer. Your challenge will be to treat everyone fairly.  Here are some \ntips on how to do that.  \nAS A SUPERVISOR \nNot all subordinates are created equal. Throughout your career, you will supervise officers, \nenlisted, civilians and contractors with varying skill levels and personalities. You will \nnaturally gravitate to your higher performers and to those with similar interests.  As the \nboss, it is imperative to always keep in mind the MSC Golden Rule, Perception is Reality!  \nUse objective criteria when making decisions.  Publications and policies are your best \nfriend; anchor your decisions to them whenever possible.   \nBe consistent.  Establish fair policies and stick to them.  Something as simple as granting \nleave can quickly turn into perceived favoritism if applied inconsistently.  Office \ncelebra",

We make many decisions every day.  Take your decision-making \n\n \n14  one step further and look at the criteria upon which you are using to base your decisio ns.  \nUsing leave as an example, there are a number of criteria to consider.

Informatio n is a commodity.  As a supervisor, you can either hoard \nit or share it.  Most information, as it applies to work, needs to be shared.  The more often \nyou can share it publicly, the better off you will be.

You are forced to navigate personalities, \nbehaviors, and interpersonal challenges that you may not otherwise select to experience in \nyour personal life.

Biases are limiting \nfactors to properly diversifying and building an inclusive organization.  \nThe more diverse and inclusive we are, the more we have to identify and correct our biases. \nIn my experience, genuine and honest conversations have provided me the ability to \nidentify and proactively check my preconceived notions. Additionally, I apply the lessons I \nlearned about an individual to that person alone and not to everyone who resembles that \nparticular profile. \nWhen building teams, I recommend asking yourself two questions: (1) who is not on my \nteam that I did not consider, and (2) why didn’t I consider them. It may simply be that you \nhave enough representation of that demographic, professional profile, etc., to meet the \nobjective. But, it could be an unchecked bias.

Learn the \nrules upfront by familiarizing yourself with civilian AFIs (mainly series 36 AFIs) and \nclearly communicating expectations, in writing and with the employee’s signature of \nacknowledgement, so that no one can say, “I didn’t know you wanted x, y, or z.”  This \nshould be different than the employee’s Performance Plan and should encompass non -\nperformance issues, such as regular duty hours, who to contact when calling in sick, \nprofessionalism, and requesting leave, among other items. \nBy not holding under-performing civilians accountable, you are doing a disservice to the \nemployee’s coworkers, the section and the mission.

It starts with knowing ourselves, then we build from there based on the choices \nwe make with that knowledge.   \n \nWhy is this truth important for feedback?  Feedback requires us to do the following: (1) if \nwe receive feedback, we look from within through introspection to try to un derstand the \ngap between what we know and what others tell us about ourselves and (2) if we give \nfeedback, we evaluated internally to determine if our actions/behavior played a role in how \nan individual is progressing/regressing and how we can help him/her  achieve their \ngoals/objectives.  \n \nWhere do we start with knowing ourselves ?  We can start with understanding our   \npersonality, our motivation/drive, our beliefs/leadership philosophy, our biases, and how \nthese relate to work performance, impact others, an d more importantly , how they manifest \nthrough our behavior.  \n \nSometimes, we don’t realize that we can be part of a problem.  That’s why it’s best to know \nyourself and find ways to improve based on that knowledge.  \n \nKNOW THE INDIVIDUAL YOU’RE GIVING FEEDBACK  TO  \n \n“You don’t even know me” can sometimes be the default response by someone we give \nfeedback to , especially when we’re addressing an issue.

Imminent situations causing \ndangerous, high risk, life safety concerns will require immediate face -to-face feedback. In \nmost cases, contractor employee feedback is needed when we observe the contractor \nemployee is not carrying out the duties within the standards outlined in the contract. The \ncontractor company is responsible for executing the obligations under the government  \ncontract. They are responsible for communicating quality, timeliness and costs directly to \nthe contractor employee; not the government. The government is responsible for ensuring \nthat services and supplies are acquired for the contractor employee to confo rm to the \nquality and performance standards written in the government contract.  \n \nAVOID interfering or providing feedback with contractor relations in the following matters \n(this goes for FREDs too):  \n \n Hire or fire a particular employee  \n Reassign or discipline an employee  \n Grant or deny leave  \no “Sure!

DON’T RUIN RELATIONSHIPS OVER AWARDS  \n \nLt Col Tara Lovell, Commander, 45th Medical Support Squadron, Patrick AFB  \n \nA common MSC saying is “your reputation precedes you ;” this is typically true the longer \nyou stay in or the more assignments you have.  In terms of awards, it is important not to \ncome across as an “award -shark” or someone who is simply chasing awards.  In order to do \nthat, make sure that you are choosing the right time to submit yourself and be mindful of \nthe possible negative perception with your peers, as well as your subordinates,  if you are \nsubmitting yourself for numerous awards.   \n \nSometimes officers will openly discuss award rotations and submissions; others may feel \nthat this is taboo.  There is nothing wrong with asking if other peers within your squadron \nare submitting for a n award, it may help you decide not write a package if you know that a \npeer has done more than you for that time period (saving you time)… but don’t ever under \nsell yourself for others.  A good rule is to allow someone to shine if more deserving.  \n          \n5.4.

In accordance with AFI 36 -2656, para 3.2.2., 100% of MSCs in the rank of \nCaptain will have the opportunity to complete SOS in residence.  \n \n“Completing IDE and SDE via distance learning is a disc riminator for selection to attend in \nresidence.”  \n \n9.3.

In \nmost cases, you’ll attend the program with hundreds of students, but will spend the \nmajority of your time in small er cohorts that are comprised multiple AFSCs and will \ninclude international and sister service students at IDE and SDE.  IDE and SDE students \ncan expect to be in the classroom Monday -Friday for approximately half of the traditional \nduty day and completing assigned reading and writing assignments the other half of the day \nwhen not in class.

WHAT CAN I EXPECT IF I COMPLETE PME VIA CORRESPONDENCE?  \n \nMost MSCs will complete IDE and SDE via distance learning (DL).  Completing PME via \nDL will require you to balance the demands of your full -time job and home life while still \nfinding time to complete your assignments.  While enrolled in DL, you can expect to spend \nsignificant off -duty time completing your assignments.  Once enrolled, the DL programs \nmust be completed within a specific amount of time before you will be disenrolled and \nrequired to begin the program again (regardless of how much or how little you completed).  \nThe basic concepts of each program are the same in both the in residence and DL versions, \nhowever you will interact with your instructor and classmates in the asynchronous \nenvironment rather than face -to-face.      \n \n“PME helped me understan d how healthcare can be used to enable the employment of air \npower and how to find an operational solution to meet warfighters’ needs.”  \n \n \nNOTE:  For specifics",

Only the certificate \ncan be uploaded into your record, it will not accept emails documenting that a certificate \nwas awarded. Once the member submits the certificate, AFPC will approve if it meets \nrequirements listed on the KX and upload into member’s record.  \n \nMembers must complet e AF 2096, via their local CSS, to have the “M” prefix added to \ntheir record (SURF).  \n \nAFPC does an annual audit to ensure member’s board certificates are current. If board \ncertification has expired, the member will be contacted through email to update. If  not \nupdated, AFPC will remove the “M” prefix.  \n \n11.3.  HOW DOES BOARD CERTIFICATION AFFECT PROMOTION BOARDS?  \n      \nO-5 is the first board where your board certification is considered.

Some things are not waiverable at \nall, but other things can be waived at the MDG or Wing level.  It might require some work \non your part, but if approved, should be worth it.  Yo ur chance for getting a waiver \napproved if you never ask is zero, so go ahead and ask, and see what happens.  \n \nFinally, don’t be afraid of open observations.  If you discovered an error in your paycheck \nand realized the Air Force owed you money, would you i gnore it and hope it resolves itself, \nor would you make sure the right people were aware of this problem and track it until it \nwas fixed?

The MSC DT selects only those who, based \non an outstanding record and reputation, demonstrate future potential in that role. What \ndoes that mean for you? ‘Excel in your current job.’  As with any competitive selection, \nthis adage holds true. The best predictor of future successful performance, is current and \nconsistent successful performance.  \n \nEXPERIENCE  \n \nAs the SGA, you are expected to be the SME on all things MSC.  Try and rotate through as \nmany MSC functional areas as possible. This isn’t to say you need to rotate through all of \nthem or you won’t be competitive.  H owever, you may be less competitive in the matching \nprocess if your experience is t oo narrowly focused , or if you do not have enough MTF \nexperience.  \n\n \n117   \nDo not worry if you are missing rotations in a few of the functional areas.  If you have the \nchance, sit down with the MSCs over those functional areas and learn as much as you can. \nPay att ention during group and squadron meetings to issues affecting those sections.  Ask \nquestions.  Shadow your fellow MSCs.  Attend a formal training course. These are just a \nfew examples of ways you can fill in any knowledge gaps you have.  \n \nAs the SGA, you ar e expected to support and weigh in on issues outside of your typical \nMDSS construct.

Stay up to date \non the process by checking the MSC Utilization and Education KX page frequently.  Each \nyear, the selection and matching process may change.  \n \nPrior to the start of the application process, it would be a good idea to have conversations \nwith your current  Squadron Commander, SGA, Group Commander, or equivalent senior \nmember on staff.  It is also a good idea to reach out to your Associate Corps Chief and/or \nMAJCOM SGA to let them know your intent and to ask for any advice or mentorship they \ncan provide.  Th ey may let you know if you are competitive, or if the timing is right for you \nin your career.  \n \nReview the SGA application guidance carefully to ensure you qualify and meet all \nsuspenses.

This is to ensure greater choices to \nthose hiring , to provide a buffer if anyone falls out , or to accoun t for more vacancies arise  \nshould they arise.  \n \nThe second step is the matching process.

In this capacity, the DO will handle administrative \nactions such as non -judicial punishment/Article 15s for a specified period of time.  In my \ncase while DO at the 43 AES, Pope Army Airfield , I was placed o n G-Series orders for a 4 -\nmonth period after the retirement of the Squa dron Commander created a  gap before the \narrival of a new inbound Squadron Commander.   \n \nDuring day -to-day operations , the DO handles a wide range of responsibilities across the \nAES from  interfacing with other flying units to arrang ing new or continuing flyin",

Utilizing your team in this way will save you \nlots of time and also serves as a way to get buy -in from other areas of the organization.  This \nmethod can result in longer program sustainment for new initiatives than if you plan, \nprogram, and roll -out a project from working inside a vacuum.   \n \nDon’t be shy about delegating, just be sure the final product is shaped to your liking as it \nultimately has your name on it.

In this \nsense, practice doesn’t necessarily mean practicing Command, it means all the jobs leading \nup to it and  all the work you put in to get ready to Command.   There are no shortcuts , and \nthere is no guaranteed path.   \n \nGiven that statement, I do believe MSCs and BSCs are given an advantage of being able to \nstart ‘practicing’ their leadership skill s almost from d ay 1 in the AFMS.  Many MSCs and \nBSCs are given Flight Command positions early on and have the opportunity to grow and \nlearn through several years.  Take advantage of it!  The more opportunity you have to \npractice, study, learn, grow, and lead  … the better  you will be when given the opportunity \nfor Command.  \n \nPerhaps the next question might be: “Ok ay, then what should I practice … what should I \nfocus on?”  In my opinion, practice building a team.

Gettin g each team member to give just a little more than usual because \nthey believe in the mission, your leadership, or that everyone is pulling in the same \ndirection.  To do that, the first step is:  you have to care about your team and your team \nmembers.  Cari ng for someone on your team doesn’t mean you’re soft.  It sometimes \nmeans discipline, extra work, or delivering difficult feedback.  You have to do it , and you \nhave to learn how to be effective at it without completely losing the member.  (Two books \nthat m ight help improve your feedback skills are: “ Difficult Conversations:  How to \nDiscuss What Matters Most ” and “Getting to Yes.”)  It also means positive feedback for a \njob well done, praise up the chain for your team, and compromise with other teams to \naccomplish the ultimate goal.  \n \n\n \n127  I could go on and on regarding this topic, (and if you want to talk more – shoot me an e -\nmail), but I’ll wrap this up with one more thought.

This is the quintessential example of knowing your audience.   \n \nMSCs can learn how to communicate with the LAF and better understand the mindset of \nthe LAF through direct mentorship.

The next portion of the syntax is 2, “=VLOOKUP(A2,$F$1:$G$11, 2,FALSE)” \nthis tells Excels to use the values in column #2 of the table array (i.e., column G) if a match \nis found between column A and column F (NOTE: column F is considered column #1).  \nThe last po rtion of the of the syntax is FALSE, \n“=VLOOKUP(A2,$F$1:$G$11,2, FALSE )”, which tells the program to capture an exact \nmatch as opposed to approximate.   \n \nOnce the syntax in column C2 is complete the next step is to copy the formula on the rest \nof the column;  figure B shows the end -result.   \n \nFigure A  \n \n\n\n \n162  Figure B  \n \n                                      \n                                                                \nOnce this is complete, you can now easily sort this report (i.e.,",

If you cannot find additional guidance through official websites, or the links \nbelow, remember, you can always conduct a Google search.  And remember, you can \nalways contact your MAJCOM functional for assistance.   \n     \n23.5. HOW TO GO ABOUT CHANGING POLIC Y OR REQUEST A WAIVER  \n \nAir Force publications include waiver approval authorities which are identified within each \ndocument with a Tier number (i.e., T-0, T-1, T-2, T-3).

Determine what you wan t to tell your audience and pick out the main points.  \n \nWhen you have creative authority don’t go too flashy.  This is event dependent and there \nmay be times when a flashy, over -the-top template actually meets your purpose.  Use it \nsparingly.   \n \nDon’t use “ eye charts”.  Whenever possible.  There are times it is part of the required \nformat.  If you are the architect do not do it.  \n \nWho are you briefing?  Senior leaders have very little time for you to present weeds.  They \nneed a quick bottom line, problem/solu tion. \n \nIf you don’t feel comfortable using PowerPoint, there are a lot of courses out there to help \nyou improve your skills.  Education and Training should be able to help you find one that \nwill meet your needs.  \n \nDo not use animation or sounds for official  briefings.  They are distracting.  They can be \nused sparingly for informal briefings but the usage has really become passé.   \n \nFinally, most often these days we are forced into templates that we strictly adhere to.
